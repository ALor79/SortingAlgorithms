# Sorting Algorithms in C
All the sorting algorithms implemented in C 


## Trying to implement all the sorting algorithms that I can find in C
## all functions in all libraries have the same basic format
  ```
  sortName(int array[],int length);//where length is the number of elements in the array
  ```



p.s. I use wikipedia's psuedo codes and I copy the comments in it because I'm not great at commenting
